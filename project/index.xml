      <title>The Validity of Counterfactual Reasoning for Fair Prediction with Imperfect Models</title>
      <link>https://jmenter-93.github.io/project/ms-counterfactuals/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Existing work on machine learning for fair prediction has leveraged causal reasoning to account for the counterfactual nature of societal discrimination. Methods that leverage this reasoning require information about the true data-generating process (DGP). However, the true DGP is often subject to mechanisms of model misspecification, including latent confounding, measurement error, and selection bias, all potentially resulting from societal discrimination. When is the validity of counterfactual reasoning for fairness impacted by these mechanisms? To articulate an answer, we describe distributional parities that must hold in training data in order for Y hat to be counterfactually fair, regardless of the algorithm or estimator used to train Y hat. Using the syntax of graphical models and d-separation, we describe the structures of model misspecification that (do not) threaten these requirements. We note that well-documented societal biases in observed data can result in model misspecifications that cause Y hat to violate counterfactual fairness. Empirically, we use a real dataset to investigate the impact of these forms of model misspecification on the task of fair prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project was to develop a stochastic model that could predict and simulate traffic load on an internet network. The model takes as input number of users and proportion of internet application being used at a given time - namely web surfing, video streaming, online gaming - and outputs simulated traffic data. Using individual user data, we produced models for web surfing, video streaming, and gaming which were combined to form the simulator. The first method fit known theoretical distributions to the data to simulate individual packets; the second used an empirical copula to simulate packets per second.&lt;/p&gt;

All of this is situated in the experiences and perspectives of the knower, i.e. myself. Therefore it is prudent for me to locate myself and acknowledge my privilege and power for any readers of my content. This is done in the tradition of feminist standpoint theory (Harding 2004).\nI am a white, queer, cisgender woman who is chronically ill and disabled, and was raised by a middle-class family in the United States. I currently live on land stolen from the Wabanaki Confederacy, Nipmuck, and Pocumtuc peoples. I attended Smith College on a scholarship for my undergraduate studies, and then the University of Massachusetts, Amherst for graduate studies, where my tuition was paid for by my employer at the time. I thus gained access to academic privilege at relatively low financial cost to myself. These experiences also connected me with mentors and collaborators with whom I still work to this day. Systems of whiteness, cisnormativity, capitalism, and classism have greatly benefited me on my journey; at the same time, I am oppressed by systems of patriarchy and ableism.\nMy position in these systems shapes my approaches to my work, especially in academic spaces. Simultaneously, I try to use my standpoint and power to support and center marginalized communities. I consistently try to reflect on the power and privilege to which I have access, and whether or not I am effectively using it to benefit those without the same access; to this end, I welcome feedback and criticism regarding all aspects of my work including my methods, framings, sources, etc.\nReferences Harding, S.

Simultaneously I was working full-time as a junior data scientist, so I had plenty of technical, pseudo-software-engineering stuff on the brain (or as much as a data scientist can have). And so I was thinking about ethics for this class, but among other things, I was also thinking about technical debt for my job.\nTechnical debt is a well-known and well-feared concept for anyone who works on any kind of technology team (although it’s usually used in reference to software development). In short, it goes like this: we choose an easy solution now, instead of a better solution that would take longer, and now we’re in “debt” because we have to do additional work to get this easy solution up to par. Maybe we were on a deadline, or we needed a quick solution, so we cut corners here, we rushed there, and suddenly we’re sitting on hundreds of lines of code that desperately needs to be refactored from the ground up.\nI can’t help but see an analog to this in many corporations’ responses to increased calls for algorithmic fairness. The mapping isn’t exactly one-to-one, of course – technical debt can have non-malicious causes, whereas I’ll argue below that what I’m calling “ethical debt” is informed by longstanding systems of oppression – but I like using it as a framework for thinking about how normative, capitalistic institutions are “ingesting” increased calls for algorithmic fairness.\nIn part, the AI ethics literature has moved from proposing various definitions of algorithmic fairness towards asking questions of how these findings can be incorporated into day-to-day practices. A valuable question that researchers are asking centers on the how – how can we incentivize, persuade, encourage practitioners to develop ethical AI solutions? I think a just-as-important question is the can: that is, can these calls for ethical AI go up against normative business goals and priorities, when the latter can be the result of longstanding systems of oppression?\nThe problem is thus deeper than run-of-the-mill technical debt, of course - we are not dealing with hundreds of lines of code, but rather hundreds of years of capitalism, white supremacy, ableism, and classism that has informed who has the power, who makes the decisions regarding these systems, who benefits from them, and who is harmed by them.\nMany scholars have already eloquently pointed out how this manifests in the tech space - that new modern technical solutions are simply reiterations of old prejudices, and different framings are required (Barabas et al. 2018; Benjamin 2019; Eubanks 2018). But what about technical solutions attempting to be “ethical” or “fair”? How far can they go to mitigate this “ethical debt”? How deeply inscribed are these “debts” in corporations that (for PR purposes or otherwise) are trying to implement “fair” or “ethical” tech pipelines? What parts of these “debts” are immutable despite implementations of “fair” tech solutions?\nBuilding on Existing Findings Some impressive scholarship has already been published that gets at the challenges of how to incentivize and allow for development of ethical AI systems in the corporate setting. Madaio et al. (2020) propose checklists to act as guideposts for this development, analogous to what is done in other fields like medicine. The authors find that AI fairness efforts are “often the result of ad-hoc processes, driven by passionate individual advocates”; moreover, organizational culture “can inhibit the efficacy of these efforts.” They note a tension between “moving fast” to ship a product versus checks and balances to consider fairness, an observation echoed by previous work in the privacy space. Their work is joined by others who, from a variety of framings, formalize how inroads to ethical AI may be deployed and enforced (Beutel et al. 2019; Greene, Hoffman, and Stark 2019).\nI have to credit Madaio et al. (2020) for acknowledging the sociocultural and technical factors involved in enforcing ethical development. They rightfully point out that some prior work in checklists have assumed that technical solutions, implemented at the individual-level, can address the operationalization of ethical AI. A key finding of Madaio et al. (2020) is that participants felt that AI checklists “must be supported by organizational culture, customizable by teams, and integrated into organizational goals and priorities…” The authors reference a lack of upstream propagation of organizational change to prioritize AI fairness.\nThese findings reveal some interesting questions, namely, can we always assume that the “core purposes” of these organizations can easily be mapped into an “ethical” space by the correct application of tools to incentivize ethical AI? This mapping itself is non-trivial and deeply complex, with many organizational, cultural, and technical moving parts.
